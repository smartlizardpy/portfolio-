    "description": "A dimly lit scene featuring a tortoiseshell cat near a concrete ledge, with another cat partially visible in the shadows near a wall. A large green dumpster is on the left side, while a wrapped pallet leans against a wall on the right. The setting is quiet and industrial, framed by lush green hedges and tall trees in the background. A white wire cuts across the image diagonally.",
